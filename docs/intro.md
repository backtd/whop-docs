# Intro

Let's discover **Whop**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **[Checking our API Documentation](https://dev.whop.com/reference/home)** first to understand the requests in this tutorial.

### What is Whop?

Whop is the marketplace for our virtual future. We help you buy, sell, and rent digital products. Think NFTs, sneaker bots, membership communities, and more.

## Creating your enviroment

In this Tutorial we will be using **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)** as our primary language.

Create a folder and cd into it:

```bash
mkdir our-awesome-project
cd our-awesome-project
```

Or simply right click and create a new folder if you are using Windows/MacOS.

Now we will need to initialize our project by using the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Then we will install an HTTP Request module and in this tutorial we will use ``node-fetch``. If you are using ES6 just install it normally but for the sake of our beginners we will use CommonJs, install it using this command:

```bash
npm install node-fetch@2
```

Version 2 supports CommonJs ``require('node-fetch')`` method, higher versions only supports ES6 ``import fetch from 'node-fetch'``.

## Conclusion

Awesome! now that you have initialized your project and installed the required modules let's head to the next tutorial.
